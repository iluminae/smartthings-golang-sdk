    # Overview

    This is the reference documentation for the SmartThings API.

    The SmartThings API supports [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), resources are protected with [OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.1), and all responses are sent as [JSON](http://www.json.org/).

    # Authentication

    All SmartThings resources are protected with [OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.1) sent on the request as an `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` header, and operations require specific OAuth scopes that specify the exact permissions authorized by the user.

    ## Token types

    There are two types of tokens: SmartApp tokens, and personal access tokens.

    SmartApp tokens are used to communicate between third-party integrations, or SmartApps, and the SmartThings API.
    When a SmartApp is called by the SmartThings platform, it is sent an authorization token that can be used to interact with the SmartThings API.

    Personal access tokens are used to interact with the API for non-SmartApp use cases. They can be created and managed on the [personal access tokens page](https://account.smartthings.com/tokens).

    ## OAuth2 scopes

    Operations may be protected by one or more OAuth security schemes, which specify the required permissions.
    Each scope for a given scheme is required.
    If multiple schemes are specified (not common), you may use either scheme.

    SmartApp token scopes are derived from the permissions requested by the SmartApp and granted by the end-user during installation.
    Personal access token scopes are associated with the specific permissions authorized when creating them.

    Scopes are generally in the form `permission:entity-type:entity-id`.

    **An `*` used for the `entity-id` specifies that the permission may be applied to all entities that the token type has access to, or may be replaced with a specific ID.**

    For more information about authrization and permissions, please see the [Authorization and permissions guide](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/develop/guides/smartapps/auth-and-permissions.html).

    <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

    # Errors

    The SmartThings API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.
    In general, a `2XX` response code indicates success, a `4XX` response code indicates an error given the inputs for the request, and a `5XX` response code indicates a failure on the SmartThings platform.

    API errors will contain a JSON response body with more information about the error:

    ```json
    {
      "requestId": "031fec1a-f19f-470a-a7da-710569082846"
      "error": {
        "code": "ConstraintViolationError",
        "message": "Validation errors occurred while process your request.",
        "details": [
          { "code": "PatternError", "target": "latitude", "message": "Invalid format." },
          { "code": "SizeError", "target": "name", "message": "Too small." },
          { "code": "SizeError", "target": "description", "message": "Too big." }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Error Response Body

    The error response attributes are:

    | Property | Type | Required | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | requestId | String | No | A request identifier that can be used to correlate an error to additional logging on the SmartThings servers.
    | error | Error | **Yes** | The Error object, documented below.

    ## Error Object

    The Error object contains the following attributes:

    | Property | Type | Required | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | code | String | **Yes** | A SmartThings-defined error code that serves as a more specific indicator of the error than the HTTP error code specified in the response. See [SmartThings Error Codes](#section/Errors/SmartThings-Error-Codes) for more information.
    | message | String | **Yes** | A description of the error, intended to aid developers in debugging of error responses.
    | target | String | No | The target of the particular error. For example, it could be the name of the property that caused the error.
    | details | Error[] | No | An array of Error objects that typically represent distinct, related errors that occurred during the request. As an optional attribute, this may be null or an empty array.

    ## Standard HTTP Error Codes

    The following table lists the most common HTTP error response:

    | Code | Name | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 400 | Bad Request | The client has issued an invalid request. This is commonly used to specify validation errors in a request payload.
    | 401 | Unauthorized | Authorization for the API is required, but the request has not been authenticated.
    | 403 | Forbidden | The request has been authenticated but does not have appropriate permissions, or a requested resource is not found.
    | 404 | Not Found | Specifies the requested path does not exist.
    | 406 | Not Acceptable | The client has requested a MIME type via the Accept header for a value not supported by the server.
    | 415 | Unsupported Media Type | The client has defined a contentType header that is not supported by the server.
    | 422 | Unprocessable Entity | The client has made a valid request, but the server cannot process it. This is often used for APIs for which certain limits have been exceeded.
    | 429 | Too Many Requests | The client has exceeded the number of requests allowed for a given time window.
    | 500 | Internal Server Error | An unexpected error on the SmartThings servers has occurred. These errors should be rare.
    | 501 | Not Implemented | The client request was valid and understood by the server, but the requested feature has yet to be implemented. These errors should be rare.

    ## SmartThings Error Codes

    SmartThings specifies several standard custom error codes.
    These provide more information than the standard HTTP error response codes.
    The following table lists the standard SmartThings error codes and their description:

    | Code | Typical HTTP Status Codes | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | PatternError | 400, 422 | The client has provided input that does not match the expected pattern.
    | ConstraintViolationError | 422 | The client has provided input that has violated one or more constraints.
    | NotNullError | 422 | The client has provided a null input for a field that is required to be non-null.
    | NullError | 422 | The client has provided an input for a field that is required to be null.
    | NotEmptyError | 422 | The client has provided an empty input for a field that is required to be non-empty.
    | SizeError | 400, 422 | The client has provided a value that does not meet size restrictions.
    | Unexpected Error | 500 | A non-recoverable error condition has occurred. Indicates a problem occurred on the SmartThings server that is no fault of the client.
    | UnprocessableEntityError | 422 | The client has sent a malformed request body.
    | TooManyRequestError | 429 | The client issued too many requests too quickly.
    | LimitError | 422 | The client has exceeded certain limits an API enforces.
    | UnsupportedOperationError | 400, 422 | The client has issued a request to a feature that currently isn't supported by the SmartThings platform. These should be rare.

    ## Custom Error Codes

    An API may define its own error codes where appropriate.
    These custom error codes are documented as part of that specific API's documentation.

    # Warnings
    The SmartThings API issues warning messages via standard HTTP Warning headers. These messages do not represent a request failure, but provide additional information that the requester might want to act upon.
    For instance a warning will be issued if you are using an old API version.

    # API Versions

    The SmartThings API supports both path and header-based versioning.
    The following are equivalent:

    - https://api.smartthings.com/v1/locations
    - https://api.smartthings.com/locations with header `Accept: application/vnd.smartthings+json;v=1`

    Currently, only version 1 is available.

    # Paging

    Operations that return a list of objects return a paginated response.
    The `_links` object contains the items returned, and links to the next and previous result page, if applicable.

    ```json
    {
      "items": [
        {
          "locationId": "6b3d1909-1e1c-43ec-adc2-5f941de4fbf9",
          "name": "Home"
        },
        {
          "locationId": "6b3d1909-1e1c-43ec-adc2-5f94d6g4fbf9",
          "name": "Work"
        }
        ....
      ],
      "_links": {
        "next": {
          "href": "https://api.smartthings.com/v1/locations?page=3"
        },
        "previous": {
          "href": "https://api.smartthings.com/v1/locations?page=1"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    # Localization

    Some SmartThings API's support localization.
    Specific information regarding localization endpoints are documented in the API itself.
    However, the following should apply to all endpoints that support localization.

    ## Fallback Patterns

    When making a request with the `Accept-Language` header, this fallback pattern is observed.
    * Response will be translated with exact locale tag.
    * If a translation does not exist for the requested language and region, the translation for the language will be returned.
    * If a translation does not exist for the language, English (en) will be returned.
    * Finally, an untranslated response will be returned in the absense of the above translations.

    ## Accept-Language Header
    The format of the `Accept-Language` header follows what is defined in [RFC 7231, section 5.3.5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.5)

    ## Content-Language
    The `Content-Language` header should be set on the response from the server to indicate which translation was given back to the client.
    The absense of the header indicates that the server did not recieve a request with the `Accept-Language` header set.

          * APP_RSA - Legacy signing mechanism comprised of a public / private key generated for an App during registration.  This mechanism requires an App to download the public key and deploy along side their integration to verify the signature in the authorization header.
          * ST_PADLOCK - App callbacks are signed with a SmartThings certificate which is publicly available at https://key.smartthings.com.  App's authorize callbacks by fetching the certificate over HTTPS and using it to validate the signature in the authorization header.

        Note that when upgrading an App from APP_RSA to ST_PADLOCK it is recommended to implement both verification methods.
        This will provide the ability to seamlessly switch between mechanisms in case a rollback is needed.

  Tags:
    description: |
      A map of user-defined tags which can be used to associate arbitrary metadata to a resource, and can be
      useful for filtering.

      * Key length must be between 1 and 64 (inclusive) Unicode characters in UTF-8
      * Value length must be between 1 and 256 (inclusive) Unicode characters in UTF-8
      * Case sensitive
      * Maximum number of tags per resource: 25
      * Reserved prefix — `st:`
      * ST-generated tag names and values are automatically assigned the `st:` prefix, which you cannot assign.
      * Use each key only once for each resource. If you attempt to use the same key twice on the same resource the last key wins.
      * You cannot tag a resource at the same time you create it. Tagging requires a separate action after the resource is created.
      * Allowed characters for *keys* are letters, plus the following special characters: `:`, `_`
      * Allowed characters for *values* are letters, whitespace, and numbers, plus the following special characters: `+`, `-`, `=`, `.`, `_`, `:`, `/`
      * If you need characters outside this allowed set, you can apply standard base-64 encoding to your tag.
